                                   <li>Latest is for stable, semver React releases. It’s what you get when you install React from npm. This is the channel you’re already using today. Use this for all user-facing React applications.</li>
                                   <li>Next tracks the main branch of the React source code repository. Think of these as release candidates for the next minor semver release. Use this for integration testing between React and third party projects.</li>
                                   <li>Experimental includes experimental APIs and features that aren’t available in the stable releases. These also track the main branch, but with additional feature flags turned on. Use this to try out upcoming features before they are released.</li>
                              </ul>

                                 All releases are published to npm, but only Latest uses <span class="inline-links">semantic versioning</span>. Prereleases (those in the Next and Experimental channels) have versions generated from a hash of their contents and the commit date, e.g. <spain class="highlight">0.0-68053d940-20210623</spain> for Next and <span class="highlight">0.0.0-experimental-68053d940-20210623</span> for Experimental.
