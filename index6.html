                                  Each of React’s release channels is designed for a distinct use case:
                              </p> 

                              <ul>
                                   <li>Latest is for stable, semver React releases. It’s what you get when you install React from npm. This is the channel you’re already using today. Use this for all user-facing React applications.</li>
                                   <li>Next tracks the main branch of the React source code repository. Think of these as release candidates for the next minor semver release. Use this for integration testing between React and third party projects.</li>
                                   <li>Experimental includes experimental APIs and features that aren’t available in the stable releases. These also track the main branch, but with additional feature flags turned on. Use this to try out upcoming features before they are released.</li>
                              </ul>

                                 All releases are published to npm, but only Latest uses <span class="inline-links">semantic versioning</span>. Prereleases (those in the Next and Experimental channels) have versions generated from a hash of their contents and the commit date, e.g. <spain class="highlight">0.0-68053d940-20210623</spain> for Next and <span class="highlight">0.0.0-experimental-68053d940-20210623</span> for Experimental.

Next and Experimental releases are provided for testing purposes only, and we provide no guarantees that behavior won’t change between releases. They do not follow the semver protocol that we use for releases from Latest.

                                   By publishing prereleases to the same registry that we use for stable releases, we are able to take advantage of the many tools that support the npm workflow, like <span class="inline-links">unpkg</span> and <span class="inline-links">CodeSandbox</span>.

                                   The degree of change between the most recent Next release and the most recent Latest release is approximately the same as you would find between two minor semver releases. However, <span class="keywords">the Next channel does not conform to semantic versioning</span>. You should expect occasional breaking changes between successive releases in the Next channel.
                                      </p>
