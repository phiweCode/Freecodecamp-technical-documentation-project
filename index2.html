                   React has been designed from the start
                    for gradual adoption, 
                    and <span class="keywords"> you can use as little or as much React as you need</span>. Whether you want to get a taste of React, 
                    add some interactivity to a simple HTML page, or start a complex 
                    React-powered app, the links in this section will help you get started.

               <h3>Online Playgrounds</h3>
            <p class="params2">
             If you’re interested in playing around with React, you can use an online code playground. Try a Hello World template on <span class="inline-links">CodePen</span>, <span class="inline-links">CodeSandbox</span>,or<span class="inline-links"> Stackblitz</span>.
            </p>
             <p class="params2">
                 If you prefer to use your own text editor, you can also <span class="inline-links">download this HTML file</span>, edit it, and open it from the local filesystem in your browser. It does a slow runtime code transformation, so we’d only recommend using this for simple demos.

            <p class="params2">
               You can <span class="inline-links">add React to an HTML page in one minute</span>. You can then either gradually expand its presence, or keep it contained to a few dynamic widgets.

               <h3>Create a New React App</h3>
            <p class="params2">
              When starting a React project, a <span class="inline-links">simple HTML page with script tags</span> might still be the best option. It only takes a minute to set up! 
            </p>

            <p class="params2">
           As your application grows, you might want to consider a more integrated setup. There are several JavaScript toolchains we recommend for larger applications. Each of them can work with little to no configuration and lets you take full advantage of the rich React ecosystem. <span class="inline-links">Learn how</span>.

            If you feel that the React documentation goes at a faster pace than you’re comfortable with, check out this <span class="inline-links"> overview of React by Tania Rascia</span>. It introduces the most important React concepts in a detailed, beginner-friendly way. Once you’re done, give the documentation another try!

               <h3>JavaScript Resources</h3>
            <p class="params2">
           The React documentation assumes some familiarity with programming in the JavaScript language. You don’t have to be an expert, but it’s harder to learn both React and JavaScript at the same time.
            </p>
            <p class="params2">
            We recommend going through <span class="inline-links">this JavaScript overview</span> to check your knowledge level. It will take you between 30 minutes and an hour but you will feel more confident learning React.

                If you prefer to <span class="keywords">learn by doing</span>, check out our <span class="inline-links">practical tutorial</span>. In this tutorial, we build a tic-tac-toe game in React. You might be tempted to skip it because you’re not into building games — but give it a chance. The techniques you’ll learn in the tutorial are fundamental to building any React apps, and mastering it will give you a much deeper understanding.

            Many React users credit reading <span class="inline-links">Thinking in React</span> as the moment React finally “clicked” for them. It’s probably the oldest React walkthrough but it’s still just as relevant.

        You can also follow the <span class="inline-links">@reactjs account</span> on Twitter, but you won’t miss anything essential if you only read the blog. </p> 

            <p class="params2">
        Not every React release deserves its own blog post, but you can find a detailed changelog for every release in the <span class="inline-links">CHANGELOG.md file in the React repository</span>, as well as on the <span class="inline-links">Releases</span> page.
